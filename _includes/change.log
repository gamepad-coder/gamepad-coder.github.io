[v10.1]

Firefox display bugfix.
Topic "#tags" coloring consistency across site.
<- Prev & Next -> buttons animated now.

[bugfix]
│           
├── +  [firefox]        Firefox does not respond to the css rule{ width: fit-content; } when fit-content() has no specific params.
│           └─          Amended each {width:fit-content} to also contain fallback options: 
│                                │
│                               (+)
│                                └──>        width: max-content;
│                                └──>        width: -moz-fit-content;
│                                └──>        width: fit-content;
│                       This should fix Firefox display on desktop + mobile too.
└                       Chrome (desktop+mobile) and Edge (desktop at least) were already responding to the unpatched line.
           

[polish]
│
├── +  [color]      Made tag colors [on post pages] + tag colors [under post previews] have the same green background.
│                   Kept purple background for tags on [list of topics] page to signify those purple tag buttons
│                   serve a different function & are internal navigation links for that page.    
│                                │
│                               (+) also
│                                │
│                   Added a z-order to each tag displayed in the preview cards
│                   (first tag items parsed in the Jekyll Liquid loop get highest values, decrements to 1)
│           
│                   This prevents the tag's box shadow from displaying over its left neighbor.
│                   Vertical margin added to prevent overshadowing lower rows 
└                   (though this still happens upon button click, but I like the split-second effect here).


< new features >
│           
├── +  added transition effect for goto next|prev post.
│           
├── +  added individual project pages under /App/(projectName).html
│                                │
└                                └──>        [~] adding summaries next.

[v10.2]

HTML processed output now tweaked to look more natural, polished Jekyll's comments.

[polish]
│
├── +  [indents]    Formatted HTML layouts & pages Jekyll inserts into them to ensure the processed output file
│                   (and the source you see when you right click -> view source on the live site)
│                   have tidy and consistent indentation.
│
├── +  [comments]   Added comments to baked HTML files indicating where Jekyll inserts 
│                   code into _Layouts & from _Includes. 
│
├── +  [comments]   Used Liquid {%- tags -%} with hyphens: this removes auto-generated newlines from Liquid commands.
│                   This whitespace is generated even for commands which produce no output.
│                   Final processed code looks so much cleaner and more consistent now.
│
├── +  [general tidying]   Took long lines and broke them into shorter lines. 
└                          This made the .html files much nicer to view and much easier to skim.
