│               when fit-content() has no specific params.
│                
│               Amended each {width:fit-content} 
│               to also contain fallback options:

├── + [blog post #tags + color]
│       │
│       └───>   Tag colors [on post pages] + tag colors [under post previews] 
│               now have the same green background.
│               
│               Kept purple background for tags on [list of topics] page 
│               to signify these purple tag buttons serve a different function 
│               (internal navigation links for different tag sections).
│                            │

│                            │
│               Added a z-order to each tag displayed in the preview cards.
│               (First tag items parsed in the Jekyll Liquid loop 
│                get highest values, decrements to 1.)
│               
│               This prevents the tag's box shadow 
│               from displaying over its left neighbor.
│               
│               Vertical margin added to prevent overshadowing lower rows 
│               (while this still happens upon button click, 
└                but I like the split-second effect here during animation).

[v10.2]


========
Summary:
========

HTML processed output now tweaked to look more natural,
polished pre-processed and post-processed spacing of Jekyll comments.


========
Details:
========


[polish]
│
├── + [indents]    Formatted HTML layouts & pages Jekyll inserts into them.
│                  Now both the (1) processed output files and 
│                  (2) the source you see when you right click -> select "view source"
│                  have tidy and consistent indentation.
│
├── + [comments]   Added comments to baked HTML files indicating 
│                  where Jekyll inserts code into _Layouts &
│                  where Jekyll inserts code from _Includes. 
│
├── + [comments]   Used Liquid {%- tags -%} with hyphens: 
│                  this removes auto-generated newlines from Liquid commands.
│
│                  Important to remember: 
│                  This whitespace is generated even for commands which produce no output.
│
│                  Final processed code looks so much cleaner and more consistent now.
│
├── + [general tidying]   Took long lines and broke them into shorter lines. 
└                         This made the .html files much nicer to view and much easier to skim.

========
Summary:
========

(1) Modified the ReadTheDocs theme for Sphinx.
    Integrated main-site's navigation bar into Documentation sub-site.
	Learned how to use Sphinx directives, referencing, toctree, and reStructuredText.

(2) Wrote a draft mockup of the Documentation subsite. 
    Tweaked and polished CSS.

(3) Wrote an AutoHotkey script to parse the paths baked by Sphinx
    and fix all URL references to mesh with Jekyll's input needs.
    
	File located in this website's GitHub under:
      /project_root/Documentation/_Sphinx/[AHK FINALIZE SCRIPT ]  Post-process
	   Sphinx output and place modified trunk in Jekyll's prebake Docs dir.ahk" 

    Processing steps documented in the script's comments. 

(4) Wrote and successfully integrated a modified custom lexer for AutoHotkey
    for Sphinx's Pygments to process language-specific syntax and reserved words.

    Sphinx's pipeline uses this custom lexer 
    with Sphinx's Pygment style named Monokai (unmodified).

    I cross-referenced the Monokai style's source code 
    and ensured all the main AutoHotkey language elements
    each have their own unique CSS class.

(5) Finally, I wrote custom CSS rules to give a nice overall color scheme
    to code blocks highlighted with my modified AutoHotkey lexer.


Infinite thanks to this blog post which saved me from spending days 
learning how to hack and inject a lexer and styler from scratch using Python:
