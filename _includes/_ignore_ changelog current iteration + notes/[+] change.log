├── + [license updated]
│        │
│        ├──>  Updated license for 2021.
│        │     
│        ├──>  Added license to each un-baked page (especially Jekyll .rst files). 
│        │     Clarifies: pre-rendered source pages are also CC0.
│        │     
│        ├──>  Made scope of license broader + more explicit.
│        │     
│        └──>  Added link to CC0 at the bottom of each license declaration:
│               https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/ 
│
├── + [clarification]
│        │
│        └──>   Elaborated in the top comment on the un-baked .css files
│               to explain the function of the empty header.
│               (Jekyll will not process a file lacking a header.)
│        
│
├── + [polished main navigation bar]
│        │
│        ├──>   Top-left corner now contains my email address.
│        │      (Before this version it was only my username.)
│        │      
│        └──>   Renamed button "Apps Written" -> to "App Gallery"
│        
│               This page is now meant to be an overview for all of them,
│               so this text is more fitting. Since initial website conception, 
│               I've decided to shift main focus to the Documentation sub-site.
│     
│     
├── + [polished Home page's wording]
│        │
│        ├──>     Minor clarifications (went through files and listed a verified wordcount).
│        │
│        ├──>     Added "Site Overview:" to the sidebar.
│        │
│        └──>     Minor changes to wording + new phrases in each section 
│                  (except for Fun, Fun is fine the way it is :)
│     
├── + [polished Home page's sidebar]
│        │
│        └──>     Minor CSS tweaks to make it apparent that the "Home" box is not a button 
│                   by visually distinguishing it from the others (consistent with navbar styling)
