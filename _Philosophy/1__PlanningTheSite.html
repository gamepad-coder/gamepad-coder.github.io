	<h2>So about this topic</h2>
	<p>
		At the time of this writing, I have the following:
		<ul>
			<li>
				Homepage with fun scrolling sidebar.
				<br />
				<span class="parenthetical">Supports mobile views.</span>
			</li>
			<li>
				Contact page with nice header pictures.
				<br />
				<span class="parenthetical">+low quality placeholders which load fast and first.</span>
			</li>
			<li>
				The styling done for the philosophy blog.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		Next up is to refactor the site to use Jekyll.
		
		I'm planning on giving each page the following:
		
		<ol>
			<li>
				A title.
			</li>
			<li>
				A cc0 picture to serve two functions:
				<ol>
					<li>Backdrop for the title on the article page.</li>
					<li>Icon for the title when viewed as an icon link.</li>
				<li style="list-style: none;">
					(<span class="parenthetical">CC0 is a Creative Commons copyright license which effectively places a work into the Public Domain. You can read more about it <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/CC0">here</a> & <a href="https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/">here</a>.</span>)
				</li>
				</ol>
				A summary: displayed on the page & displayed under the icon linking to the post from other places in the Blog.
			</li>
			<li>
		</ol>
	</p>
	<p>
		I'll go ahead and make a few posts for testing and revising the layout and HTML + CSS formatting, get it reasonably polished, --> then move on to making the application highlights pages --> then move on to making my API documents with Sphinx.
	</p>
	<p>
		Feeling good about this.
