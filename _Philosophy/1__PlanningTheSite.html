				At the time of this writing, I have the following:
				<ul>
					<li>
						Homepage with fun scrolling sidebar.
						<br />
						<span class="parenthetical">Supports mobile views.</span>
					</li>
					<li>
						Contact page with nice header pictures.
						<br />
						<span class="parenthetical">+low quality placeholders which load fast and first.</span>
					</li>
					<li>
						The styling done for the philosophy blog.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				Next up is to refactor the site to use Jekyll.
				
				I'm planning on giving each page the following:
				
				<ol>
					<li>
						A title.
					</li>
					<li>
						A cc0 picture to serve two functions:
						<ol>
							<li>Backdrop for the title on the article page.</li>
							<li>Icon for the title when viewed as an icon link.</li>
						<li style="list-style: none;">
							(<span class="parenthetical">CC0 is a Creative Commons copyright license which effectively 
								places a work into the Public Domain. You can read more about it 
								<a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/CC0">here</a>

							</span>)
						</li>
						</ol>
						A summary: displayed on the page & displayed under 
						the icon linking to the post from other places in the Blog.
					</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
			<p>
				I'll go ahead and make a few posts for testing and revising the layout 
				and HTML + CSS formatting, get it reasonably polished, --> then move on to 
				making the application highlights pages --> then move on to making my API documents with Sphinx.
			</p>
			<p>
				Feeling good about this.

			<article>

			</p>
			<p>
				So. <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/">Jekyll</a> is awesome. Documented very well, though there are a few oversights and 
				<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/62077452/13536555">undocumented features</a>. 
				The Jekyll's version of the Liquid language has a few eccentricities (<span class="parenthetical">and at times, bugs:
				Jekyll's implementation of Liquid's {%raw%}{%else%}{%endraw%} and {%raw%}{%elsif%}{%endraw%} statements were 
				completely not functioning when I began, but a recent update has patched this</span>),
				but all-in-all I absolutely love it, and it was totally worth the days of learning (+) setup.

			</p>

			<h2 id="Section_{{section_id}}">Brief note on a hurdle with Jekyll</h2>
			<article style="line-height: 1.6em;">
			<p>
				Most unintuitive thing was casting integer variables. <br>
				Once I got a variable out of an array, lines such as<br>
				 {%raw%}(debug: item holds: {{item}} ){%endraw%} would output as expected:<br>
				 <span class="code indent">(debug: item holds: 4 )</span>.<br>
				 But then any attempts to increment it resulted in [0].
			</p>
			<p>
				Complicating troubleshooting was the advice to cast Liquid variables explicitly before math operations 
				could be applied to them using <br><span class="code indent">{%raw%}{% var = var | plus: 0 %}{%endraw%}</span>.
				<br>(<span class="parenthetical"> I believe I found references to this requirement for both to Jekyll's implementation of
					Liquid and the official version of Liquid</span>)
			</p>
			<p>
				Eventually, I discovered the debug filter {%raw%}<span class="code">{% var | inspect %}</span>{%endraw%}, 
				and found out that my item variable was actually a 1-element-long array containing the integer, 
				and I had to access it with item[0] to get the first (and only) element.
			</p>
			<p>
				Although it's really nice to output an array without any syntax indicating the internals of
				the background programming language, this made debugging this issue a really elaborate series
				of searches and hurdles. But I understand the design choice, and honestly 
				(<span class="parenthetical">in the context of all you can do with Jekyll and Liquid</span>) it's incredibly polished. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="parenthetical">
					Sidenote for clarification: this is more a catalogue of bread-crumbs for me to remember this journey than it is a critique. 
					And a reminder for me to come back and contribute documentation when I'm financially stable + have enough time to do it well.
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				I jumped into this website project with just a month's worth of HTML+CSS understanding, 
				and this was the only issue I encountered with Jekyll.
			</p>
			<p>
				Despite these growing pains, I really enjoyed the whole experience: it's incredibly elegant, powerful, and simple.

			<h2 id="Section_{{section_id}}">This Blog's<br>Jekyll Setup</h2>
			<article style="line-height: 1.6em;">
			
			<p>
				So where did I land with this integration + development journey?
			</p>
			<p>
				Someplace amazing.
			</p>
			<p>
				New posts just need a very minimal amount of variables added to the top, 
				then I can just focus on defining the main content of the new post, 
				entirely omitting the HTML for the site's header, footer, and sidebar.
			</p>
			<p>
				Once I have a new post written, Jekyll's templating wraps the rest of the common HTML around it, 
				and constructs a complete HTML page that is styled similarly to the rest of the Blog Site.
				This is awesome, because:
				<ul>
					<li>
						<u>It save a ton of time and work</u> <br>
						(<span class="parenthetical">and a TON of rework if I change a single thing <br>
							and need that one change applied to every single page</span>).
					</li><br>
					<li>
						It lets me have separate files for 
						<ol>
							<li>
								the blog structure,
							</li>
							<li>
								individual blog post content
							</li>
						</ol> 
					</li><br>
					<li>
						<u>It saves a TON of time and work</u>,<br> really, it's incredible.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p><br>
			<p>
				Similarly, I don't need to copy+paste the HTML formatting for each post header,
				nor do I need to manually add tags below each post:
				I've written a series of simple Liquid commands to generate the HTML 
				for these, and call upon these utilities using Jekyll's /_Include/ feature. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Any new #topics I include in a post are auto-magically added 
				to the PostsByTopic.html page (along with automatically rendered post-previews under each tag). 
			</p>
			<p>
				All posts are automatically added to the PostsByTime.html page 
				(again, totally hands-off, the templating and Liquid code do all the repetitive lifting here).
			</p>
			<p>
				All I have to do is make a new post.html file,<br> 
				write a few variables containing 
				<ul>
					<li>
						the name,
					</li>
					<li>
						the tags,
					</li>
					<li>
						the time written
					</li>
					<li>
						the blog #
					</li>
				</ul>
				add only HTML for the post's core text, <br>
				then the automation packages it all and references it across the site.
			</p>
			<p>
				I would have started playing with web design a long long time ago had I known about this sooner 
				(<span class="parenthetical">and if I didn't have a plethora of tasks 
					surrounding my large AutoHotkey hobby-project</span>).
			</p>

			<h2 id="Section_{{section_id}}">Concluding Remarks.</h2>
			<article style="line-height: 1.6em;">
			
			<p>
				Overall, I love Jekyll and the Liquid Language in general. 
				Jekyll is a really powerful way to separate core page content from 
				repeated structures. It took a good while to set up this site
				(<span class="parenthetical"> divided pretty evenly between Jekyll experiments, 
					CSS styling, and setting up the <a style="font-family: monospace;" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about">
						Windows Subsystem for Linux</a> (WSL) </span>), 
				but adding additional posts is extremely hands-off for me now.
			</p>

			<p>
				Wordpress seems nice. 
			</p>

			<p>
				But I'm glad I decided to make a website from scratch.
