			<h2>About this website:</h2>
			<article>
					<p>
						I am currently seeking a job as a technical writer, so I created this website to serve two purposes:
						<ol style="padding-left:60px">
							<li>
								Showcase my personal documentation.
							</li>
							<li>
								Contextually display my different writing styles.
							</li>
						</ol>

							<p>(TO-DO) Manuals, API calls, tutorials, and directions for extending my open-source programs will be 
								presented in this portion of this website.

								I truly love writing documentation and tutorials. 
								System design and analysis is a compulsive hobby for me. 
								I thoroughly enjoy learning about and memorizing complex systems.
								However, to me, it is even more satisfying to take a complex internal understanding -&gt; and portray it as a clean, straighforward, delineated progression. When considering your audience may include a range of (a) novices (b) those with partial understanding and (c) those with intimate understanding, it's always a fascinating puzzle to solve with a balance. If my passion is not evident in the Documentation section of my website, I hope my cleanliness and presentation will show at least my competence.

			<h2>I am a writer.</h2>
			<article>
					<p>
						I think incessantly, and as a byproduct: I write a lot.
					</p>
					<p class="intro_philosopher_linespacing">
						I've been programming for 15 years, verbosely writing documentation for personal projects 
						for 10 years, and learning web design since May 2020 <span class="parenthetical">(the month I was furloughed from my job at a book store due to Covid-19)</span>.
					</p>
					<!-- 
							[~] Add overview of strengths with writing styles.
								Links to where to see each one.
								To the point up front for the busy.

						Combining all of my: 
						<ul>
							<li>
								code,
							</li>
							<li>
								documentation <span class="parenthetical">(personal + Open Source contributions)</span>,
							</li>
							<li>
								tutorials <span class="parenthetical">(primarily posted to online Q&A sites)</span>,
							</li>
							<li>
								essays <span class="parenthetical">(on mediacraft, philosophy, ethics, human nature, self improvement, brains, and the subconscious)</span>,							
							</li>
							<li>
								notes <span class="parenthetical">(on ideas for future projects, design principles, brainstorms, 
								game ideas, outlines for sprints, etc.)</span>, 
							</li>
							<li>
								fiction stories, 
							</li>
							<li>
								and poetry
							</li>
						</ul>
						I have written at least 240,000 words over the last decade.

			<h2>I am a programmer.</h2>
			<article>
				<p>
					My main life goal is to create a GNU desktop environment specifically 
					<span class="parenthetical">(and comprehensively)</span> tailored for education, 
					complex data organization, self-improvement, and game design. Contemporary operating 
					systems are incredible for file management. However the human angle is often centered around files, 
					instead of files being centered around human need as their core purpose.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the meantime, I am building my skills and knowledge-base in pursuit of this ideal.
				</p>
				<p>
					Presently, this site mainly details a framework I wrote for AutoHotkey 
					and a few productivity utilities I've built using it. 
					Progress is ongoing and it is by no means exhaustive in coverage yet, 
					but it will be useful to anyone working with complex user interfaces in AutoHotkey.
				</p>

			<h2>I am a game designer.</h2>
			<article>
				<p>
					My current game plan is to build utilities to organize my plethora of personal notes, 
					then shift gears to design and program videogames.
				</p>
				<p>
					I am determined to publish a commercially successful game within 20 years. But, more importantly, 
					I want to hone my abilities to create and portray information in novel and streamlined ways.
					Fortunately, practice with software related to building videogames brings me closer to both endeavors.
				</p>
				<p>
					My end-goal is to create tools which allow users to easily craft educational experiences 
					that feel like <span class="parenthetical">(and are as fun as)</span> playing videogames. 
					Many lessons would be better served as interactive models, especially for students. 
					I would love to see the day where every textbook has an app companion which has interactive 
					3D models for every chapter and topic.
				</p>

			<h2>I am, primarily, a philosopher.</h2>
			<article>
				<p>
					Have you ever had a moment of realization which... completely filled you with awe?&nbsp; Thinking 
					about infinity?&nbsp; Or learning about atoms for the first time?&nbsp; Or trying to picture 
					the immensity of the entire universe with all its stars and galaxies?&nbsp; Or exploring 
					that alien world of microscopic intricacies inside the machinery of our own cells and DNA?&nbsp; Or 
					appreciating the vast diversity of information our brains can provide to us on a whim?
				</p>
				<p>
					As a child, I savored and cherished all the moments when I learned something so new, wild,
					and fantastic about any of the many systems of our universe.&nbsp; 
					I've spent all my life in pursuit of three things: 
						<span>
						<ol>
							<li>
								Finding the love of my life.
								<br><span class="parenthetical">[Status: Check!]</span>
								<br><br>
							</li>
							<li>
								Discovering (and cherishing)
								as many eureka moments as I can.
								<br><span class="parenthetical">[Status: Perpetually in progress :) ]</span>
								<br><br>
							</li>
							<li>
								Becoming the best and most ethical version of myself I can envision.
								<br><span class="parenthetical">[Status: Perpetually in progress :) ]</span>
								<br><br>
							</li>
						</ol>
						</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					I've written a copious amount of personal essays, explorations, and realizations 
					but never published -- thinking I would eventually compile them into a series of 
					books by topic and release them <span class="parenthetical">(either commercially 
						or even just into the public domain)</span>.
				</p>
				<p>
					So while I was in the process of putting together an online portfolio, I thought 
					it would be nice to aggregate some of my ideas and writings into a blog.

							This website adapts to your window orientation.

						<br />
						If you are on a desktop computer, try playing with:
							<ul style="margin-top: 5;">
								<li>
									the dimensions of the window <span class="parenthetical">(when the window is a tall rectangle, the sidebar automatically moves to the top of the page to save space)</span>
								</li>
								<li>
									zooming in and out <span class="parenthetical">(ensure the window's width is greater than its height for this to have an effect)</span>
								</li>
							</ul> 
						<br />
						If you are on mobile, try:
							
							<ul style="margin-top: 5;">
