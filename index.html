			<h2>I am a writer.</h2>
			<article>
					<p>
						I think incessantly, and as a byproduct: I write quite a lot.
					</p>
					<p class="intro_philosopher_linespacing">
						I've been programming for 15 years, verbosely writing documentation for personal projects for 10 years, and fiddling with web design since May 2020.
					</p>
					<p>
						Combining all of my personal code+documentation, essays on mediacraft and philosophy, notes (<span class="parenthetical">on ideas for future projects, design principles, brainstorms, game ideas, outlines for sprints, etc.</span>) and fiction stories:&nbsp; I have written over 1,000,000 lines of text.
					</p>
			</article>
			
			<h2>I am a programmer.</h2>
			<article>
				<p>
					My main life goal is to create a GNU desktop environment specifically (<span class="parenthetical">and comprehensively</span>) tailored for education, complex data organization, self-improvement, and game design. Contemporary operating systems are incredible for file management. But the human angle is often centered around files, instead of files being centered around human need as their core purpose.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the meantime, I'm building my skills and knowledge-base in pursuit of this ideal.
				</p>
				<p>
					Presently, this site mainly details a framework I built in AutoHotkey and a few utilities I've built using it. Progress is ongoing and it is by no means exhaustive in coverage yet, but it might prove useful to someone working with more complex projects in AutoHotkey.
				</p>
			</article>
			
			<h2>I am a game designer.</h2>
			<article>
				<p>
					My current game plan is to build utilities to organize my plethora of personal notes, then move on to design and program videogames.
				</p>
				<p>
					If I can manage to publish a commercially successful game, cool. But more than that I want to hone my abilities to create and portray information in novel and streamlined ways.
				</p>
				<p>
					My end-goal here is to be able to create tools to craft educational experiences that feel like (<span class="parenthetical">and are as fun as</span>) playing videogames. Many lessons would be better served as interactive models, especially for students. I would love to see the day where every textbook has an app companion which has interactive 3D models for every chapter and topic.
				</p>
			</article>
			
			<h2>I am a philosopher.</h2>
			<article>
				<p>
					Have you ever had a moment of realization that... just filled you with awe?&nbsp; Thinking about the universe?&nbsp; Or the immensity of stars and galaxies?&nbsp; Or the world of microscopic intricacies inside the machinery of our cells and DNA?
				</p>
				<p>
					As a child, I savored and cherished those moments where you learn something so new, wild, and fantastic about the natures of the world or the fabric of the universe.&nbsp; I've spent all my life in pursuit of two things: <span><ol><li>finding the love of my life, and</li><li>discovering (<span class="parenthetical">and cherishing</span>) as many eureka moments as I can.</li></ol></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					I've written a copious amount of personal essays, explorations, and realizations, but never published -- thinking I would eventually compile them into a series of books by topic and release them (<span class="parenthetical">either commercially or even just into the public domain</span>).
				</p>
				<p>
					So while I was in the process of putting together an online portfolio, I thought it would be nice to aggregate some of my ideas and writings as a blog.
				</p>
			</article>
			
			<h2>About this site:</h2>
			<article>
					<p>
						At the time of this writing, I'm preparing to release my object-oriented encapsulation library for AutoHotkey's GUI (<span class="parenthetical">graphical user interface</span>) functions.
						Documentation, API calls, tutorials, and directions for extension will be expanded upon over the next year.
					</p>
					<p>
						I am currently seeking a job as a technical writer, and decided to make this website function additionally as a showcase for a variety of my writing styles.
					</p>
