			<h2>About this website:</h2>
			<article class="welcome_article additional_bottom_margin">
					<p>
						
						<p class="homepage_welcome">Welcome to the <span class="asideBar__Home__nav_ref">Home</span> page!</p>
			
					</p>
					<p>
						I am currently seeking a remote job where I can work as 
						either a software developer or a technical writer. 
						So I created this website to serve three purposes:
						<ol class="more_indented_ordered_list">
							<li>
								Showcase my personal code + documentation.
							</li>
							<li>
								Contextually display my different writing styles.
							</li>
							<li>
								Demonstrate my willingness and ability to learn new frameworks and skills.
							</li>
						</ol>
					</p>
					<p>
						I'd never used CSS before creating this website, 
						and only had a cursory familiarity with HTML.
						Building this website was a great use 
						of my time during the pandemic: 
						I learned so much, had a lot of fun, 
						and discovered some great toolchains.
					</p>
					<p>
						I put a lot of labor and love into making 
						<a href="/Apps.html#h_thisWebsite" style="
							background: rgba(0,0,0,0.5); 
							padding: 2px 5px;
							border-radius: 7px;
						">this website</a>,
						and I'm happy with how it turned out. 
						But if you think of any small tweaks or additions, I'm open to 
						suggestions. Feel free to click the 
						<a href="/contact.html" style="
							background: rgba(0,0,0,0.5); 
							padding: 2px 5px;
							border-radius: 7px;
						">contact</a>
						link (found in the upper-right corner of each page) 
						and send me an email. Enjoy!
					</p>
			</article>
			
			<h2>Post-Portfolio Plans:</h2>
			<article class="welcome_article additional_bottom_margin">
					<p>
						Primarily, this website is currently a portfolio.
						But I really like how it turned out, 
						and I'm going to continue adding to this website long-term.
					</p>
					<p>
						After finding a job, I'll continue post tutorials and walkthroughs for programs. <span
						class="parenthetical">(And I'll ensure that all current URLs 
						in the Documentation section remain valid, regardless of any future tweaks)</span>.

					<input id="home__collapsible_section_1" class="toggle_collapsible_section" type="checkbox">

								color: aqua;
							"> Current State: </p>
							<p>
								The <a href="/Documentation.html" class="nav_ref">Documentation</a> 
								section has the most content, at the moment.
							</p>
							<p>
								For the sake of presenting a learn portfolio, I've written two thoroughly annotated
								AutoHotkey scripts. You can read both of them with full syntax highlighting 
								and code block folding in the AutoHotkey subsection of the Documentation area.
								<br /><br />
								<a href="/Documentation/AutoHotkey/Utilities/Program_Launcher/index.html">"Program Launcher"</a>
								is a small script I wrote years ago in AutoHotkey. 
								I use it every day, but the initial version was not extensible 
								<span class="parenthetical">(and definitely not in a clean 
									nor clear enough state to distribute online)</span>.
								So I decided to rewrite it and expand it from scratch, documenting each step and algorithm.
								<br /><br />
								The result is a clean, well-designed program which you can configure easily with
								a graphical user interface.
								<br /><br />
								<a href="/Documentation/AutoHotkey/Utilities/Emulate_Numberpad/index.html">"Emulate Numberpad"</a>
								is a short script I wrote for someone on the internet who was discontent that their 
								laptop didn't have a numberpad. With this script, you press a hotkey and it 
								converts the keystrokes for keys 7,8,9 (and the keys below them) into keystrokes 
								which you typically need a numberpad to send. Pressing the hotkey again turns this mode 
								off and returns the keyboard to its normal state.
								<br /><br />
								Pictures, overviews, and the complete scripts for both
								can be found inside this website's 
								<a href="/Documentation/AutoHotkey/index.html" class="nav_ref">Documentation/AutoHotkey</a> section.
							</p>				
							<p style="
								font-weight: bold;
								font-size: x-large;
								color: aqua;
							"> Future Plans: </p>
							<p>
								Manuals, API calls, tutorials, and guides 
								for extending my open-source programs will be 
								added to the Documentation area. 
								<br /><br />
								As I experiment more with Godot, I'll add tutorials for 
								both basic and advanced scripting.
								<br /><br />
								I also plan to add a subsection to my Documentation named "Web"
								where I'll outline how this website and 
								the Documentation section itself was built.

									Personal note:
								</span>
							</p>
							<p>
								<span class="parenthetical">
								I began writing extensively commented code in college, 
								and ever since graduation I've been extremely grateful for the great 
								practices and habits my professors instilled in me. 
								<br /><br />
								Concise but complete documentation
								prevents mistakes, eliminates ambiguity, and
								increases productivity. But good documentation itself 
								has an overall zen and peaceful aesthetic, 
								formed from precise and practical blocks, which I never tire of. 
								<br /><br />
								System exploration, analysis, and design are compulsive hobbies for me. 
								I thoroughly enjoy learning about and memorizing complex systems.
								<br /><br />
								However, to me, it is even more satisfying to take a complex internal understanding 
								-&gt; and portray it as a clean, straightforward, delineated progression. 
								When considering your audience may include a range of <br />								
								(a) novices <br />
								(b) those with partial understanding and <br />
								(c) those with intimate understanding, <br />
								it's always a fascinating puzzle to solve with a balance. 
								<br /><br />
								If my passion is not evident in the Documentation section of my website, 
								I hope my cleanliness and presentation will show at least my competence.

			<h2>I am a programmer.</h2>
			<article>
				<p>
					I've been programming for 15 years, verbosely writing documentation for personal projects 
					for 10 years, and learning web design since May 2020.
				</p>
				<p>
					My main life goal is to create a GNU desktop environment specifically 
					<span class="parenthetical">(and comprehensively)</span> tailored for education, 
					complex data organization, self-improvement, and game design. Contemporary operating 
					systems are incredible for file management. However the human angle is often centered around files, 
					instead of files being centered around human need as their core purpose.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the meantime, I am building my skills and knowledge-base in pursuit of this ideal.
				</p>
				<p>
					Presently, this site mainly details a framework I wrote for AutoHotkey 
					and a few productivity utilities I've built using it. 
					Progress is ongoing and it is by no means exhaustive in coverage yet, 
					but it will be useful to anyone working with complex user interfaces in AutoHotkey.
				</p>
			</article>
			
			<h2>I am a game designer.</h2>
			<article>
				<p>
					My current game plan is to build utilities to organize my plethora of personal notes, 
					then shift gears to design and program videogames.
				</p>
				<p>
					I am determined to publish a commercially successful game within 20 years. But, more importantly, 
					I want to hone my abilities to create and portray information in novel and streamlined ways.
					Fortunately, practice with software related to building videogames brings me closer to both endeavors.
				</p>
				<p>
					My end-goal is to create tools which allow users to easily craft educational experiences 
					that feel like <span class="parenthetical">(and are as fun as)</span> playing videogames. 
					Many lessons would be better served as interactive models, especially for students. 
					I would love to see the day where every textbook has an app companion which has interactive 
					3D models for every chapter and topic.
				</p>
			</article>
			
			<h2>I am, primarily, a philosopher.</h2>
			<article class="additional_bottom_margin">
				<p>
					Have you ever had a moment of realization which... completely filled you with awe?&nbsp; Thinking 
					about infinity and paradoxes?&nbsp; Or learning about electricity and atomic elements for the first time?&nbsp; Or 
					trying to picture the immensity of the entire universe with all its stars and galaxies?&nbsp; Or exploring 
					that alien world of microscopic intricacies and machinery inside our cells and DNA?&nbsp; Or 
					appreciating the vast diversity of information and creativity our brains can provide on a whim?
				</p>
				<p>
					As a child, I savored and cherished all the moments when I learned something so new, wild,
					and fantastic about any of the many systems of our universe.
				</p>
				<p>
					I've spent all my life in pursuit of three things: 
						<span>
						<ol>
							<li>
								Finding the love of my life.
								<br><span class="parenthetical">[Status: Check!]</span>
								<br><br>
							</li>
							<li>
								Discovering (and cherishing)
								as many eureka moments as I can.
								<br><span class="parenthetical">[Status: Perpetually in progress :) ]</span>
								<br><br>
							</li>
							<li>
								Becoming the best and most ethical version of myself I can envision.
								<br><span class="parenthetical">[Status: Perpetually in progress :) ]</span>
								<br><br>
							</li>
						</ol>
						</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					I've written a copious amount of personal essays, explorations, and realizations 
					but never published -- initially thinking I would eventually compile them into a series of 
					books by topic and release them.
				</p>
				<p>
					While I still intend to publish a book or two eventually, 
					it's not likely I'll have enough time to exhaustively give each idea the time it deserves.
				</p>
				<p>
					So while I was in the process of putting together an online portfolio, I thought 
					it would be nice to aggregate some of my ideas and writings into a blog, 
					to have a place to publish stray ideas sooner rather than later.
					Mainly for fun, but also for a little peace of mind.
