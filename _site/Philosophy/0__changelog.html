│              to use &lt;details&gt; instead of &lt;input&gt; and &lt;label&gt;.
│              (To be more specific, this feature is a foldable section of text
│               that allows scripts to be minimized/hidden/collapsed
│               until the user clicks the button for the section, revealing the script.)
│      
│              Now that these blocks also use the &lt;details&gt; tag, users can 
│              use keyboard navigation to move 
│

│                 -> to go through the foldable sections of code inside
│      
│              by using TAB and SHIFT+TAB to navigate to next and prev respectively
│              and using SPACE to toggle the fold/unfold state.
│      
│              Most importantly, keyboard navigation with TAB is now consistent, 
│              and users can even skip over the codeblock containers and reach 
│              the previous page / next page buttons. I added visual outlines 
│              to these buttons (when navigated to using the keyboard) 
│              by using the CSS pseudoelement :focus-visible.

│     │     
│     │                  Details:
│     │     
│     │     In v18 I added navigation buttons to the sidebar, 
│     │     and Sphinx's output HTML files looked fine.
│     │     However, Sphinx doesn't have access to the toplvl assets 
│     │     in the Jekyll build dir, and the fully baked site 
│     │     (after Jekyll processes it) had the topmost part of the sidebar 
│     │     nudged up and off the top of the screen.
│     │     
│     │     This was due to the added margin for the new sidebar footer buttons.
│     │     
│     │     Sidebar footer buttons are now set to position:fixed 
│     │     and the height of the original sidebar is now (through trial and error)
│     │     minimized to "height: 93%". This works well, even in mobile view.
│     │     
│     │     Added a small box shadow to these footer buttons while I was patching this.
│     │

│     ├──>  Removed an invisible element that was only there by oversight.
│     │     
│     │                  Details:
│     │     
│     │     In my initial layout draft for the Docs subsite, I adapted the toplvl CSS 
│     │     for the topmost Documentation page (so navigation between Home.html, 
│     │     Documentation.html, Apps.html, and Philosophy.html would have consistent
│     │     header bars and layouts to make the whole thing feel like a menu rather 
│     │     than seperate pages). Then all other Documentation pages use a different 
│     │     CSS file (to match the feel of other ReadTheDocs themed websites, with a
│     │     few tweaks here and there, like the added nav bar).
│     │     
│     │     Unfortunately, I forgot a conditional for the sub-pages of the 
│     │     Documentation subsite, and the floating footer from the Home.html page 
│     │     was being copied to every sub Documentation page.
│     │
│     │     This footer was incompatible with the ReadTheDocs CSS, and was invisible.
│     │     Not a huge bug, but it was taking up space unnecessarily, and not quaintly.
│     │     Fixed.

│        └──>   [+] Implemented code folding inside of code blocks.
│               
│                            V1 Implementation :
│               
│               Code blocks can be generated by Sphinx's .. code-block:: directive.
│               At the time of writing this, there is no option to insert foldable regions.
│               
│               "Folding" is when you have a block of code,
│               and you expand or contract entire regions.
│               
│               Since folding drastically improves readability of code, 
│               I wrote a script to manually insert &lt;details&gt; HTML elements
│               into the HTML pages after they are produced by Sphinx.
│               
│               This took a significant amount of experimentation,
│               and I'm very happy with the result.
│               
│                               V1 Problem :
│               
│               At the time of this writing, it is very difficult
│               (if even possible) to alter the ::marker pseudoelement 
│               which is automatically inserted whenever you use the  
│               &lt;details&gt; element. 
│               
│               This ::marker has a dynamically calculated margin-right.
│               
│               Because of this, a big problem arose for my use case.
│               
│               Each line of mono-spaced text which was wrapped 
│               in a &lt;details&gt; element's &lt;summary&gt; header 
│               was becoming mis-aligned any time the zoom changed
│               (because the ::marker's margin fluxuates on zoom).
│               
│                            V2 Implementation :
│               
│               I recreated the Details triangle displayed by its ::marker
│               with a ::before pseudoelement. The functionality is the same
│               but now my theme can control the margins and ensure they 
│               remain persistent.
│               
│               Now (1) my Docs have foldable code regions 
│               and (2) mono-spaced fonts are staying properly aligned.
│               
│                                  Sources :
│               
│               To replace ::marker with ::before, these were very helpful.

│              The black areas in the upper-left and upper-right are now

│              Rounded remaining edges.

│               └──> Why?
│              
│                    The CSS rounded border was clashing with the harsh edges of the icon.
│                    Now the icon's corners are rounded, so it seems natural at a glance.

│        └──>  Modified the CSS for the RTD Theme Sidebar TOC 
│              to give the [+] expand [-] contract icons 
│              more clickable width and height beyond the text.
│              
│                                Details:
│              
│              Before this update (and by default) if you click 
│              1 pixel above or below the [+] or [-] icon
│              then you are taken to that TOC entry's URL instead of 
│              expanding or contracting the Table of Contents branch.
│              
│              To accomplish this:
│              
│              (1) Expand the padding of the span which wraps the icon.
│                  (This gives the user much more room for error 
│                   when trying to press the expand/contract icons.) 
│ 
│              (2) Negatively offset the same span's margin 
│                  by the amount of padding added in (1).
│                  This keeps the Table of Contents looking identical 
│                  to the vanilla theme.

├── + [Documentation]
│        │
│        └──>  Fixed the sidebar not appearing when on the Docs top page.
│
│                      Details:
│
│              The normal Read-The-Docs sidebar from the Sphinx_RTD_Theme
│              has a CSS rule "position:fixed;". 
│              
│              In order to display the consistent site header at the top of each main page 
│              (reachable through the navigation buttons at the very top)
│              I've changed this CSS rule to "position:absolute;". 
│              
│              However, as an oversight I forgot to account for the side-effects 
│              when using this CSS rule on a mobile device or in portrait mode.
│              
│              Before this fix, when you pressed the "hamburger" menu button 
│              (trivia: the name for the menu icon with three horizontal lines)
│              it was not displaying properly.
│              
│              Fortunately, the fix was simple. The RTD Sphinx theme automatically 
│              appends an additional class named "shift" to the navigation container 
│              which holds the sidebar (which, whether hidden or not, always
│              has at least the class "wy-nav-side").
│
│              Thanks to the design of the RTD Sphinx theme, there is one CSS rule 
│              which applies to ".wy-nav-side" to make it absolute, 
│              and another CSS rule applied to ".wy-nav-side.shift" to make it fixed, 
│              only when the hamburger button is clicked.
│              
│              CSS is incredible and elegant. Can safely say at this point I love it.
│              
├── + [Changelog]
│        │
│        └──> Forgot to escape HTML tags inside the change log.
│             I'm using Jekyll to copy my changelog into the Blog Entry #0.
│             
│             Since some of the comments refer to Jekyll code, 
│             the entire block is wrapped in a 
│                 {&#x25; raw &#x25;} and {&#x25; endraw &#x25;} tag pair,
│             which tells Jekyll not to process anything in between.
│             
│             However, I forgot that HTML will interpret (sometimes) 
│             additional open tags as the user having forgotten the close div tag, 
│             and will open a new HTML element in the DOM. 
│             
│             Example: 
│             
│               "Today I added a new &lt;div&gt;container&lt;/div&gt; for some new feature!"
│             
│             When jekyll inserted this div inside the notes into the changelog div in Blog #0
│             the web browser interpreted the nested notes containing the 
│             &lt;div&gt;'s as part of the website (sometimes a good feature, here unintentional)
│             and suddenly the &lt;div id="changelog_box"&gt; (which contains all this text) 
│             was ended prematurely, and the notes accidentially became HTML code.
│             
│             Double-edged sword and whatnot.
│             
│             This is now corrected, all future HTML references in the changelog will be
│             mentioned with entity encodings only, and this changelog page should no longer 
│             be severely broken :)
│             
│             See the file Jekyll inserts into Blog #0 here:
│                https://gamepad-coder.github.io/changelog

========
Summary:
========

(1) Modified the ReadTheDocs theme for Sphinx.
    Integrated main-site's navigation bar into Documentation sub-site.
	Learned how to use Sphinx directives, referencing, toctree, and reStructuredText.

(2) Wrote a draft mockup of the Documentation subsite. 
    Tweaked and polished CSS.

(3) Wrote an AutoHotkey script to parse the paths baked by Sphinx
    and fix all URL references to mesh with Jekyll's input needs.
    
	File located in this website's GitHub under:
      /project_root/Documentation/_Sphinx/[AHK FINALIZE SCRIPT ]  Post-process
	   Sphinx output and place modified trunk in Jekyll's prebake Docs dir.ahk" 

    Processing steps documented in the script's comments. 

(4) Wrote and successfully integrated a modified custom lexer for AutoHotkey
    for Sphinx's Pygments to process language-specific syntax and reserved words.

    Sphinx's pipeline uses this custom lexer 
    with Sphinx's Pygment style named Monokai (unmodified).

    I cross-referenced the Monokai style's source code 
    and ensured all the main AutoHotkey language elements
    each have their own unique CSS class.

(5) Finally, I wrote custom CSS rules to give a nice overall color scheme
    to code blocks highlighted with my modified AutoHotkey lexer.


Infinite thanks to this blog post which saved me from spending days 
learning how to hack and inject a lexer and styler from scratch using Python:

   Bugfixes for "file.html/#tag" + missing CSS ';' + fixed footer styling for large screens


========
Details:

- Forgot a ';' in one or a couple CSS styles 
  for the navigation bar translucent background color.
  This displayed properly on most browsers 
  but old version of Samsung mobile browser it didn't display bg color at all.
  Hopefully this commit patches that glitch.
- Tags references in the "View Philosophy Blog Posts by Topic." 
  & Tag references under post titles were not properly linking,
- "file.html/#tag_id" -> "file.html#tag_id"

========
Summary:
========

   Added "Tags" to Blog sub-site using 
   - liquid templates 
   - Jekyll includes
     
   Fancy CSS styling for blog "Tags".


========
Details:
========

Added a page listing each tag
& the posts which reference each one.

Tags are auto-populated by reading front-matter in Jekyll posts 
under collection: Philosophy (folder /_Philosophy/..)

Two Jekyll includes added, one as a generation method to create card previews of posts
by reusing the title code of blog post page & reformatting it to fit in a nice flex row.

Tags are clickable and animate upon click.

Cards of posts nudge on hover and react by lowering opacity when clicked.

2nd include method places tags under the post card.
Also used for placing under the post page's title.

A liquid {{ include.param }} is used as a switch 
to add the CSS style depending on 
[] if adding to a preview card or
[] if adding to a page title.

So happy & tired. Awesome progress. Almost done.

   LowQ Contact headers -> now .jpg's ; further mobile support tweaks


========
Details:

Discovered the button in the Chrome + FFox developer bar
to preview mobile views (and different screen resolutions).

Added a few more CSS edge cases, 
for example:
   cases applying only when screens are wider than 350px 
   so font isn't placed offscreen.

Testing .jpg's for low quality topic header backgrounds 
for Contact page to try to (mostly) prevent empty bg while picture loads.

   Setting auto margin for flex col breaks sticky sidebar in Firefox (works in Chrome)


========
Details:
========

With a flex-flow, auto margins push the content to the extreme available position.

The last commit works fine in Chrome (desktop + mobile). 

But the auto margin for the sticky sidebar 
breaks the sticky sidebar feature in Firefox 
(both on desktop and also on mobile).

Patched by keeping the same top and right margins (while omitting specifying the other two).
Works on desktop for Firefox + Chrome. About to test on mobile.

Summary:
========
   
   New:
   (+) contact page, 
   (+) more screen zoom/size cases


========
Details:
========

Added contact page.
Added picture backgrounds for contact sidebar.

Polished sidebar's size and display for narrow screens/windows & phones.

Added a middle case between default zoom on 1080p landscape monitor & mobile layout:
  scrollbar should stay visible and on screen regardless of window placement and size now.

Moving on to gallery & short description overviews next.

Summary:
========

   Pages consistent, mobile(/portrait) view layout support, minor layout tweaks


========
Details:
========

Spent hours yesterday commiting and testing.

Reverted the extraneous single change commits to stable version before yesterday:
--> this commit contains all polished changes from yesterday's removed commits, all combined.

Added &lt;meta name="viewport" .. initial-scale=1" ..&gt; for best fit on android phone && tablet.
(This enables support for the CSS "@media all and (max-width: ..)" selectors.)

Polished code flow of CSS + made comment sections more clear.

-----------------------------
main progress and
exploration yesterday
-----------------------------

Added a blue background to the body 
and made the page gradient as a &lt;div&gt; with ID website_background.

Chrome + Firefox on Android (phones + tablets at least) 
have a (known) glitch due to implementation of the virtual viewport and height calculation :
  - Upon scrolling down on mobile, the navigation bar will hide.
  - As the URL bar / address bar hides, it changes the viewport's reported height. 
  - This affects the background image for a moment, 
    and until the initial scroll down is released: 
      a proportional white space appears at the bottom of the screen
      (because the background (gradient in this case) effectively is "scrolling"
      as the url bar changes the top of the screen loc).
  - Upon navbar hide + initial drag release, the white area pops away 
    and the background fills seamlessly automatically without custom html or CSS code.

There seems to be an easy JQuery recipe fix which adds a page resize listener
and dynamically preempts this white space glitch.
  - That's beyond my present knowledge base for web 
    && beyond the reasonable scope of putting this portfolio together this week.
  - But noted for future should I continue fiddling with web.

Moving on to project showcase page & topical description pages.

Then moving on to integrate Sphinx with my AHK libraries 
and begin cleaning and documenting and generating static pages & navigation.

Then setting up a simple static blog.

Then Web part is mostly done and just need to do the fun part: typing.

Feeling good about this.

========
Summary:
========

   New:
   sticky sidebar + polished colors


========
Details:
========

Added a sticky sidebar.
Tweaked background gradient.

Upon extreme zoom (or for mobile):
   Nav bar and the sticky sidebar now toggle 
   from horizontal layout -> to a column arrangement

Going to do Jekyll next and make templates.

Going to tweak home button for consistent size, bugfix needed.

Happy with the progression.

[v1.1]

========
Summary:
========

   Updated (the only) CSS file:
   grouped by type


========
Details:
========

Put all the fonts together
Put all the background+borders together
Put all the layouts together.

And had a little fun with comment headers 🎨

// dev note
Might leave the nav links alone for now, 
and focus on getting the main content to display well on mobile.

========
Summary:
========

  First draft. 
  Jekyll installed, but abstractions not utilized yet


========
Details:
========

Basic site setup.

Placeholder pages for everything except homepage.

Going to refactor navigation bar into a flex layout next.

Then see if I can get the page to readjust on extreme zoom + on mobile.

Then onto Jekyll + liquid templates.
