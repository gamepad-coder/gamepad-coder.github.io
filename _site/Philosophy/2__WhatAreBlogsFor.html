                        It seems like a simple enough question to answer. But like
                        any question, exploration of the first topics which come to
                        mind will (if we hold on to our curiosity) reveal yet more
                        questions. Let us first explore how we explore, then apply
                        this process to answering the question “What are blogs for?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="indent_paragraph">
                        We are presented with a Question. When our mind does not at once present us with
                        a prepackaged Answer (and if it interests us) we explore. As we branch further
                        out from our initial point of inquiry, typically the mind will find relations
                        between different threads and clump them into categories. By branching out more,
                        then returning to our original question, then branching again: general areas
                        become mapped.
                    </p>
                    <p class="indent_paragraph">
                        As we grow in our understanding of a particular area of thought,
                        we become a bit more oriented, and can more easily find our way between future
                        threads. Further, as our internal cartography becomes more robust, we can
                        navigate from areas of related topics up to a birds eye view: where we can peer
                        down at the overarching umbrella which thematically groups related topics as a
                        set.
                        <br><br>
                        Our modes of thinking, conscious or not, gain much utility
                        and efficiency by following this course: 
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            We compare local topics,
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            then jump up to the umbrella topic level,
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            compare other umbrella topics with our starting point,
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            then explore
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            and ultimately locate a lower topic under a different
                            umbrella than the origin. 
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        This results in connecting a beginning and ending point
                        which otherwise we wouldn’t have thought to compare or
                        cross-examine. Or (in other words) we find a way to bring
                        two found thought-objects into the same room-of-thought,
                        stand back, and observe them side-by-side.
                    </p>
                    <p class="indent_paragraph">
                        By assembling these umbrellas, traversing up into them, then
                        back down into another area, thematically related threads
                        become linked, and our internal maps (and functional roads
                        between them) become faster and more robust. And besides
                        utility: it’s fun. As a concrete example, the topic of this
                        introduction itself would be a fun thread to explore in a
                        future essay.

                        We think, we explore, we find, we compare. This abstract
                        portrait (of knowledge seeking and refining) is necessarily
                        present in the brain of anyone who writes a cooking blog, an
                        art blog, a technical blog, a personal journaling blog, or
                        any kind of blog. So as a beginning, we can start with this:
                        <br>

                    <p>
                        And as creatures with brains which compulsively seek to
                        understand and to be understood, we can assert the (perhaps)
                        most immediate and low-hanging-fruit of possible answers to
                        this question.
                        <br>

                        This seems like a nice, concise answer. But it lacks flavor.
                        It doesn’t really capture the feeling of the
                        many-possible-stews with many-possible-ingredients of forces
                        which motivate one to create a blog in the first place, nor
                        the equally rich variety of experiences of different
                        audiences with (potentially) different mind-states: each
                        perusing different, uniquely-homespun aggregations of
                        “shared explorations”.

                        I’d like to assert that this isn’t a pointlessly concise
                        answer, though in a vacuum its utility is arguably small
                        (but what isolated tidbit in a vacuum isn’t?). The real use
                        of this answer (and all similarly over-generalized answers)
                        resides in where it guides us, not in what it explains by
                        itself. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="indent_paragraph">
                        Let’s discard for a moment all the reasons that might
                        possibly lead someone to write a blog concerning: 
                    </p>

                            personality inclinations

                        Just for now. These are especially important angles to
                        explore, but by ignoring them for a bit, we can better form
                        and mold the thought-clay of our conception of what blogs
                        are in essence. First let’s look at blogs via the lens of
                        recorded information.
                    </p>

                <h3 id="Section_3" class="additional_top_margin">&ldquo;In terms of information, what is a blog?&rdquo;</h3>
                <div class="section_3_wrapper">
                    <p class="indent_paragraph">
                        Possibility trees. Attributes. Let’s start. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Typically when we talk about blogs, we’re referring to a
                        kind of website which has posts (or pages in general)
                        and the author adds more periodically. If a blog had
                        only a single page which never changed, I don’t think
                        we’d call that a “blog”, we’d just say “that one
                        website”. But not all websites with multiple pages are
                        “blogs”. You wouldn’t call a series of search results on
                        Google a blog, nor would you refer to the shopping pages
                        on Amazon a blog. Blogs tend to refer to something more
                        homey, more personal, or perhaps intentionally episodic
                        in nature.
                    </p>
                    <p class="indent_paragraph">
                        So what types of multi-page websites do feel like blogs?
                        Let’s see. A blog could be like a journal. A blog could
                        also be a series of notes or tutorials on a specific
                        topic (with a little sidebar of similar entries or other
                        related posts by the author). A blog could even just be
                        random things which the author periodically appends new
                        entries to. The one thing that seems to tie blogs
                        together as a concept is that they have entries. But
                        what types of content can exist in these entries to
                        qualify as a blog? What data, and for what purpose?
                    </p>
                    <p class="indent_paragraph">
                        In terms of content, a blog can either be an active
                        exploration on paper (“exploration on screen” doesn’t
                        quite have the right connotation) or a delineation of
                        useful tidbits that resulted from past explorations of
                        the author or group.<a id="footnote_1_ref"
                        href="#footnote_1" style="color:blue;"><sup>[[footnote 1]]</sup></a> These
                        explorations could lean towards more-informative or
                        more-personal, but there’s no fixed rule, and both seem
                        to be very common. A blog can be a static historical
                        progression, or it can be an evolving series of
                        informative posts which are refined as better solutions
                        occur to the author. In the latter example, perhaps the
                        author appends or rewrites information (especially in
                        the case of software tutorial blogs) as the times and
                        technologies change, to keep the blog current and
                        up-to-date. Or maybe the author of a cooking blog
                        discovers a glorious tweak to a recipe, and updates the
                        original post with the delicious revision.
                    </p>
                    <p class="indent_paragraph">
                        So blogs always have content. Either the author is
                        exploring information in the blog itself (much like this
                        post) or the author has already discovered something and
                        is posting it (much like cooking blog recipes). Having
                        said this, let’s look again at a counter-example.
                        Wikipedia is a series of pages with recorded facts and
                        information. I don’t think we’d call Wikipedia a blog
                        website, though it has a series of entries. So blogs are
                        somehow different from a catalog of information, and
                        different from encyclopedias in general. This leads us
                        back to the whole “blogs are more homespun/ personal/
                        like journal entries” type of definition. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="indent_paragraph">
                        You might be thinking, “Cool, so blogs are blogs.
                        Information served and organized as entries, with a
                        personal and episodic spin.” And I think that’s a nice
                        and concise way to think of blogs. However, something
                        occurred to me while writing this, and I’d like to throw
                        this monkey-wrench into our definition-machine: 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <span class="indent">
                            If blogs are just episodic or personal tidbits, how
                            are blogs different from letters?
                        </span>
                    </p>
                </div>    
                
                <!-- Are blogs the same as written letters? -->
                <h3 id="Section_4" class="additional_top_margin">&ldquo;Are blogs the same as written letters?&rdquo;</h3>

                    <p class="indent_paragraph">
                        You might already see where I’m going with this. Imagine
                        two people sending letters back and forth. Now look at a
                        single letter, and look at a single page from any blog.
                        Both the page and the blog entry are “pages” of
                        information, personal data assembled as a stream of text
                        (let’s assume they’re both just text for simplicity). In
                        this way, blogs can be seen as the digital bloom of
                        flowers rising out of our species’ history of writing
                        correspondence. And this notion is beautiful in all
                        kinds of ways:

                            A) Blogs connect our modern lives to the traditions
                            and inclinations of those who came before us.

                        <li>
                            B) Blogs embody in modern times: the idealized
                            vision of someone writing a letter by candlelight
                            (only now it’s LCD’s and LED’s).

                        <li>
                            C) Blogs are a testament: as humans, we love writing
                            so much that we brought the possibility into our
                            machines, breathing the romantic spark of creation
                            and creative correspondence into the otherwise cold
                            heart of our machines. Etc. :)

                        Although I’m being a bit playful here, I really do think
                        there’s a beautiful and important connection between
                        blogs and letter writing. Only before, we’d write
                        correspondence to a particular individual, household, or
                        organization. And now, we write blog entries sometimes
                        totally unaware of who our readers might be. In a way, I
                        think this is a lens which can help us discern whether a
                        website is a blog or not. You ask: “Is this website a
                        series of letters from the author to the reader over
                        time?” To which one might rebut: “Then is an email chain
                        a blog?” 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Which leads me to the answer I think I’ll leave it at for now.

                        To summarize, if I stretch myself to be as forthcomingly
                        honest as I can, partially I’m posting this to a small
                        tucked-away corner of the internet to satisfy a
                        freshly-reawoken-itch-due-to-the-pandemic: the fancy of
                        creating a small work to last a small amount of time,
                        yet nevertheless to last longer than my mortal
                        coil. Maybe that’s a bit too somber, but I think it’s
                        beautiful. The whole passing-the-torch combined with
                        standing-on-the-shoulders-of-giants type of thing. I’ve
                        always loved those notions. It both humbles and
                        astonishes to look at the big picture, this long play of
                        Humanity which we get to shape and contribute to for
                        some-number-of years. To boil-it-all-down to a
                        concentrated notion: throwing essays into this blog is a
                        fun way to go about doing what I always do in a slightly
                        new way. And this brings me joy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To summarize the overarching umbrella theme of all
                        writings I create, I suppose you could say my personal
                        trope is this: “To explore and share the methodologies
                        by which we explore and share.” I am fascinated by
                        meta-self-reference and full-circles, and this
                        conclusion satisfies both checkboxes nicely for me.

                        antithesis of some fragment or style above and find
                        inspiration from a derived counter-example. Have as
                        excellent of a day as you are able, however high that
                        may be today. Strive for the better: don’t stop running
                        from fine and racing towards your personal best. And
                        remember to cherish small moments. There are many
                        beautiful things in this Universe, whoever and whenever
                        you are. Warm wishes.

                    (Brief tangent: I think it could be fairly asserted that any
                    time someone repeats the task of outlining a series of
                    steps, there’s a bit of exploration in the process of
                    re-assembling the author’s mental knowledge into external
                    concrete steps. Re-discovery, re-assembly, and potentially
                    unique re-iteration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, even when the written-out (or spoken-out, etc.)
                    series of steps is an exact replica, I like to think that
                    the (writer/speaker/etc)’s patterns of neural firings are
                    not exactly identical each time they produce the identical
                    external work. Though perhaps not important, I thought this
                    was a fun enough concept to add here.)
