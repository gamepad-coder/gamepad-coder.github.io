				<div class="collapsible_section">
					<p>
						Made back in 2013. My first large experiment.
						<br> Windows can be dragged, zoomed, grouped, 
						<br> typed into, saved and loaded.
					</p>
	
					<p>
						Built in the <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity</a> game development environment, 
						and written in "UnityScript" (<span class="parenthetical">a language loosely based on 
						JavaScript</span>). I later ported it to C# in 2014 in order to have better support 
						for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(computer_science)">polymorphism</a>

				<label for="apps_collapsible_section_2" class="label-toggle_collapsible_section">Purpose:</label>
				<div class="collapsible_section">
					<p>
						My initial plan was to build a framework for AR and VR (<span class="parenthetical">Augmented
						Reality and Virtual Reality</span>), but integrating further support for web, video, audio, and
						other media seemed like it was going to be a laborious task. So I decided to move on and build
						on top of platforms where I could easily work with existing files and code libraries, instead of
						writing each media utility from the ground up.
					</p>
					<p>
						It was an incredibly fun project, and it was my first big trial by fire where I learned how to
						better manage and organize large complex projects.

				<label for="apps_collapsible_section_3" class="label-toggle_collapsible_section">Math:</label>
				<div class="collapsible_section">
					<p>
						In my first iteration, I had windows in the same plane (parallel to the screen, all the same
						distance away from the camera). This caused severe visual glitches whenever portions of two or
						more windows overlapped. <span class="parenthetical">I was new to Unity and game engines and 3D,
						and if there was a workaround for this, I was unable to discover it at the time.</span> To
						remedy this, I ended up learning a lot about 3D vector math.
					</p>
					<p>
						[~] note to self, add diagrams here.
					</p>
					<p>
						I spaced windows away from the others, giving each its own plane in 3D. Then they could move around
						the user's screen without any anomalies nor visual chimera glitches. But placing windows further
						from the camera makes them smaller. So as windows are placed further away, they are proportionally
						resized to maintain the appearance that all of the windows were located in the same "Desktop" plane.

					<p>
						When I move back to working on 3D interfaces again, I may revisit this project, clean it with
						the better practices I now know, and upload a version of source code which can run on modern
						versions of Unity. But likely I will instead make a more elegant solution than this one. It was
						an incredible learning experience though.

						Written in C, then ported to C++. Runs in a Linux terminal, and plots individual pixels to the
						screen. Keyboard input only.
						<br><br>
						Windows can be moved and resized. Windows contain lines and headers (which contain sub-sections of
						more headers and lines). Headers can be folded and expanded, allowing quick navigation between dense
						sets of hierarchical data without ever taking your hands off the keyboard.

				<div class="collapsible_section">
					<p>
						In this app the screen is rendered from blocks, like a chess board. The screen's grid of blocks does
						not change location nor size, but behind it is a canvas <span class="parenthetical">(which can move
						around)</span> filled with windows and lines and characters <span class="parenthetical">(which can
						also move around)</span>. Think of the screen's grid like a camera fixed in place while people move
						around within <span class="parenthetical">(or outside of)</span> its view. Every time the program
						paints pixels to the screen, the screen's grid "camera" takes a snapshot of blocks it can currently
						see, and displays them at actual pixel coordinates on the computer's monitor.

					What this app does
					<br>from the top down:</label>
				<div class="collapsible_section">
					<p>
						The canvas can place windows anywhere, and can scroll to view windows placed off the screen.
						Windows can be moved and resized. Windows have a solid background color for each block they
						display within the grid system. Windows can additionally assign a default foreground color for
						text <span class="parenthetical">(different from the workspace's default font color)</span>.
						Windows contain a border of solid-colored grid elements, and a central document. The central
						document contains rows of lines. Lines can be one of two types: [1] a simple line of character
						objects to display and edit [2] or a header, which functions as a simple line, but additionally
						has a sub-document grouped under it. Headers can fold <span class="parenthetical">(i.e. collapse
						and hide their sub-document region, showing only their title)</span> and unfold. Header titles
						can be edited just like any other line. Sub-documents under headers can contain lines of either
						type. 
						<br><br>
						When the user selects a window, then activates it, the program shifts into line selection mode.
						Once the desired line is selected, the user hits [CONTROL+ENTER] to shift from line selection
						mode -> into editing mode. From here line characters can be typed, selected, copied, pasted, and
						deleted as if typing in a standard text editor. [CONTROL+ENTER] likewise shifts back from text
						editing mode -> back to line selection mode.
						
						<br><br>Lines store a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list">linked-list</a> of
						character objects. Each character object has: a foreground color, a background color, references
						to neighbors, and the symbol to display at its grid coordinate. <span class="parenthetical">(To
						specifically differentiate, let's define "symbol" in this context to mean: a letter, number, or
						any visible character which results from hitting a key on a keyboard.)</span> 
						<br><br> When the program draws to the screen, each grid element with a window will report what
						is located at each blocky grid coordinate. Borders for windows tell the grid to paint a single
						color at each pixel in that rectangle. Coordinates in a window which do contain a character
						object report their block's background color and which foreground color the grid should paint
						their symbol. When the character object tells the grid which symbol to draw, the grid looks up
						that symbol in the font object.
						<br><br>The font object is a series of 2D regions I programmed manually. Each region has
						elements containing 1's and 0's representing pixels in a rectangle. The 1's are the pixel
						positions in the rectangle to draw the symbol, and the 0's represent where to draw the
						background color. Each typeable character on the keyboard is mapped to one of the 2D regions in
						the font array <span class="parenthetical">(fun example: the 2D region mapped to the space bar
						is all 0's, resulting in an empty box; pure background color)</span>.
						<br><br>
						So the grid gets the foreground, the background, and the symbol data, then paints the pixels
						onto the portion of the screen associated with that grid coordinate's region.
						<br><br>This process is repeated for each window and each line on the screen until... viola! You
						have a screen with blocks and letters and colors.
						<br><br>
						Next up, how to use it.

						<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_nano">Nano</a> is a minimalistic but fantastic <a
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface">command-line interface</a> text
						editor that can be found on most Linux distributions.
					</p>
					<p>
						It uses a code library called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ncurses">ncurses</a>, which
						I initially used to build the first versions of this project. Ncurses basically lets you define
						text and colors at positions on a grid, and it makes writing a text editor from (mostly scratch)
						a breeze.
					</p>
					<p>
						Later I was curious about how Linux displays images, simple graphics, and command line
						terminals. So I began investigating <a
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_framebuffer">the framebuffer</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						 In addition to using the framebuffer, I retrieved the hardware signals of my keyboard from
						 Linux in the form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scancode">scancodes</a>. From there
						 I set up branches of code to account for how to react to different key presses and different
						 combinations.

						This experiment was incredibly fun, and was my first foray into interacting with hardware on a
						low level. Surprisingly, the biggest utility from this project was how it made me start thinking
						about hardware and software in a more comprehensive way. It really bridged a gap for me between
						my understandings of high level frameworks &lt;-(&)-&gt; the 1's and 0's that power, organize,
						and encode everything above. And seeing a bit beneath the hood closer to the machine processes
						has given me a lasting appreciation for the history of computing in general, and for all the
						sub-processes that have been working inside my computers all my life.

				<h3>A New Journey:</h3>
				<p>
					First time studying Web Design with HTML5 + CSS.<br><br>
					I'd never heard of the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> static website builder
					nor the <a href="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/">Sphinx</a> documentation generator when I started,
					but I absolutely love both of these tools now.<br><br>
				</p>

				<h3>Beginning with Jekyll and a Dream:</h3>
				<p>
					I had a basic idea in mind when I started, but I soon realized that if I wanted to 
					make each page have a consistent <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>
					<span class="parenthetical">
						(the navigation bar and image at the very top), 
					</span>
					then I would be duplicating a lot of code. Coming from my background of using low-level languages,
					the notion of necessary code duplication was strange to me. But I was mainly worried about keeping
					it all in sync. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Imagine this scenario. Say I were to start with a homepage and a <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>. Then I make a second page.
					I copy the homepage's <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> code and paste it into the second page. Any time I create a new page, I
					need to make sure it contains this code 
					<span class="parenthetical">
						(in order to have a consistent presentation as the 
						user navigates between pages).
					</span>						
				</p>
				<p>
					If later I were to change even one part of the <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, then I would have to
					manually update the <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> code of each and every page to match that
					change.
				</p>
				<p>
					This approach is not efficient and the product would not be easy to maintain.
				</p>
				<p>
					So I searched the internet. I read that there were tools for building 
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page">"static" websites</a>, and I soon discovered
					the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. If you need to make a website, but you're not using
					a lot of JavaScript to dynamically insert content, I highly recommend Jekyll.
				</p>
				<p>
					Briefly: Jekyll lets you define a basic layout, then you can wrap new pages inside the shared
					layout. You can define multiple layouts, and use variables to (a) determine what content to
					insert or (b) to generate content using your variables. It's awesome.					
				</p>
				<p>
					Code duplication exists once Jekyll bakes your website into an output directory. But in your source
					files, you just write code once (and tell Jekyll where it should be inserted). Instead of
					duplicating large sections, you just type <code>{{ content }}</code> or <code>{% include
					some_file.html %}</code> and you're done! 					
				</p>
				<p>
					For an example, here is a link to this page's content file on GitHub:
					<a href="https://github.com/gamepad-coder/gamepad-coder.github.io/blob/master/Apps.html">
						Apps.html</a>. This is the file before Jekyll bakes it into the finished HTML page.
					You'll notice this file doesn't contain a <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> tag. When Jekyll 
					bakes this Apps.html page, Jekyll takes the
					<a href="https://github.com/gamepad-coder/gamepad-coder.github.io/blob/master/_layouts/Layout_Default.html">
						Layout_Default.html</a> file and pastes the Apps.html file into the 
					<code>{{ content }}</code> line inside Layout_Default.html. <br><br>
					Resulting in: the page you're looking at now!
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="parenthetical">If this is interesting to your,
					or if you'd like more details, you can read my initial impressions of Jekyll in 
					<a class="nav_ref" href="Philosophy/1__PlanningTheSite.html"
					style="font-size:small;">[Blog Post #1]</a>.</span>
				</p>

				<h3>Making Manuals:</h3>
				<p>
					Long story short, I love the websites for <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/">Godot's documentation</a>
					and <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/">Blender's documentation</a>. I knew I
					wanted to use the <a href="https://sphinx-rtd-theme.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">ReadTheDocs theme for
					Sphinx</a> for my Documentation section from the beginning. It took a fair amount of time to learn
					<a href="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html">Sphinx</a>, <a
					href="https://pygments.org/docs/">Pygments</a>, and <a
					href="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html">reStructuredText</a>,
					but it was absolutely worth it, and incredibly fun.
				</p>
				<p>
					However I faced a few minor problems:

					<ol>
						<li>
							I wanted to keep my <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> bar on my baked Documentation pages.
						</li>
						<li>
							I needed to find a way to take the HTML structure which Sphinx outputs -> and make it 
							compatible with my Jekyll processing pipeline.
						</li>
					</ol>
				</p>

				<h3>Automation:</h3>
				<p>
					After I discovered Sphinx, I had to be a little creative to make Sphinx's output files 
					compatible with the needs of Jekyll's input files.
					<span class="parenthetical">
						I'm using Sphinx for the entire Documentation section, but I'm using Jekyll for all other pages. 
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					To modify all my Sphinx-generated HTML files, I began automating a lot of manual tweaks and
					insertions by utilizing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">Regular Expressions</a>
					for the first time. 
					<span class="parenthetical">
						Then I reached a point where AutoHotkey was malfunctioning when performing
						Regular Expression replacements across huge files, so I began studying Python for the first
						time. I ported my AutoHotkey automation into .py scripts, and it's been amazing ever since. Now I can run
						these pre-processing and post-processing .py scripts from either Windows, or from my Debian 
						<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/">WSL2</a> command line.
					</span> 
				</p>

				<h3>Creating Code-Block Folding:</h3>
				<p>
					Recently, I wanted to add code-block folding to my Documentation section.
					Sphinx was capable of fully highlighting my AutoHotkey code (after a few minor modifications), but had no support 
					for folding regions of code. So I wrote a pre-processing script in Python to manually insert 
					arbitrary tags near every open <code>{</code> curly brace and different arbitrary tags near 
					every close <code>}</code> curly brace.
				</p>
				<p>
					I wrote a post-processing Python script to take the HTML 
					files which Sphinx generates, and replace my arbitrary tags with the HTML <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> element 
					(which has built-in functionality for collapsing/folding blocks of text). It was really different for me, 
					but pretty straightforward, and very fun.
				</p>
				<p>
					You can try out my custom code-block folding here: 
					<ul>
						<li>
							Click this link:&nbsp; <a class="nav_ref" href="/Documentation/AutoHotkey/Utilities/Emulate_Numberpad/index.html">Docs: Emulate Numberpad</a>
							<br>
						</li>
						<li style="
							margin-top: 1rem;
						">Then scroll to the bottom and click the box: 
							<span style="
								-webkit-box-shadow: -11px 10px 2px -2px rgb(0 0 0 / 30%), 0 1px 0 rgb(255 255 255 / 10%);
								box-shadow: -11px 10px 2px -2px rgb(0 0 0 / 30%), 0 1px 0 rgb(255 255 255 / 10%);
								border: 1px solid rgba(28, 160, 189, 0.47);
								font-size: initial;
								font-weight: bold;
								/* display: block; */
								margin-top: 14px;
								/* margin-bottom: 24px; */
								margin-left: 10px;
								padding: 0.1rem;
								color: #2a8b9b;
								background-color: white;
								margin-top: 20px;
									">emulate_numpad.ahk</span>
						</li>
						<p></p>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<h3>Short Writeup:</h3>
				<p>
					If you'd like to read more about the toolchains I use (and what my pre-processing 
					and post-processing scripts do) I've written a short overview on 
					<a href="https://github.com/gamepad-coder/gamepad-coder.github.io">this website's GitHub repository page</a>.
				</p>

				<h3>In Summary:</h3>
				<p>
					I began this website with a portfolio concept, but I kept working on it because I really enjoyed it.
