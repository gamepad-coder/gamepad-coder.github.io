============================================

Welcome to my documentation.

| All of my programs here are free and open source, 
| licensed with `Community Commons Zero <https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/>`_  (cc0).

.. note:: 
    I plan to add more to this website and keep it online long-term. 
	But for now it mainly serves as a manual for an AutoHotkey framework I wrote 
	to build Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) in AutoHotkey using Object Oriented Design (OOD).

    As time permits, I will aggregate my notes and experiments with Godot and upload them here also.

Have a great day, and enjoy.
