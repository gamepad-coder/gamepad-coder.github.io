Welcome to my documentation.

.. note:: 
   
   I plan to add more to this website and keep it online long-term. 

   But for now the majority of content is documentation surrounding an AutoHotkey framework I wrote 
   to build Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) in AutoHotkey using Object Oriented Design (OOD).

   As time permits, I will upload my notes, experiments, and tutorials for Godot here.

Have a great day, and enjoy.
