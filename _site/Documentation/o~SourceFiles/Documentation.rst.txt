Welcome to my documentation.

.. note:: 
    
    If you're primarily here to look at my code, here are two annotated scripts I've prepared:
    
    * :doc:`Emulate_Numpad.ahk </AutoHotkey/Utilities/Emulate_Numberpad/index>`
    * :doc:`Program_Launcher.ahk </AutoHotkey/Utilities/Program_Launcher/Code/Complete_Script/index>`

    |details_open| While browsing this website, you'll come across sections that look like this.
    Click either the text (or the arrow) to "unfold" the region and reveal the hidden text. |summary_close|    
    |hr|
    |indented_block|     
    Congrats! Now you're prepared to navigate this Documentation website.
    
    Whenever you see that arrow, it'll fold or unfold a region of the page.
    On this website, those arrows will never navigate you away from the current page.
    
    Presently, you'll find those arrows in ``Hint`` and ``Tip`` boxes like this.

.. note:: 
   
   Primarily this website is a portfolio for my code and writing styles.
   
   But I'm definitely going to add more to this website and keep it online long-term. 
   
   I plan on uploading my notes, experiments, and tutorials for Godot here.
   And as time permits, I plan on documenting the tool chains, pre-processing scripts, 
   post-processing scripts, and custom modifications I've used 
   to create this website under a ``Web`` section.
