.. note::
    
    There are a lot of quality introductory tutorials and websites for Godot
    already. |i|\ (`Click here <../index.html#resources>`__ to navigate to the

    So the documentation here will be a little more niche. 
    
    With any application or programming framework, there are always many
    ways to approach solving the same problem. And there are always edge
    cases which no one has documented in detail yet.
    
    Any time I encounter a problem or use case in Godot and it takes me longer
    to research the problem than it does to actually implement the code, I'll 
    do a writeup and post an overview here.
    
    Godot is my main hobby at the moment, so I anticipate this section growing
    to become the largest on my website.
