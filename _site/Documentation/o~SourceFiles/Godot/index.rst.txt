=====================

.. image:: /_static/images/Godot_logo.svg

Godot is...

* free and open source software ("FOSS")
* used to create both 2D and 3D games
* an editor (a.k.a "development environment") to arrange and program game assets
* an great alternative to commercial game creation software

Godot is also...

* a full game engine (which drives games created with the editor)
* elegantly designed, featuring hierarchical organization of nodes
* cross-platform
* well-documented
* currently being ported to run inside web browsers, thanks to a grant from Mozilla

.. warning::

   Depending on when (in the development cycle) you fetch and build Godot from the main branch:

   * the code should be mostly stable if a major version is about to come out
   * however, far between releases *(as new features are introduced and debugged
     across different operating systems and computer architectures)*, your build
     might be unstable.

   Either way, it's always fun to see the latest state and direction of software.
